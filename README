DateTime::Subspan::Weekly - Determine whether event falls within weekly
recurring range

    use DateTime::Subspan::Weekly qw( in_range );

    $rv = in_range( {
        starting_date   => $starting_date,  # Hash ref
        range           => $range_ref,      # Hash ref
        target          => $dt,             # DateTime object
    } );

Suppose that a 'week' can begin at an arbitrarily chosen day of the week
and time of day. Suppose further that that week can be divided into two
subspans: one in which an event is permitted to occur, and the other in
which the event is not permitted to occur.

DateTime::Subspan::Weekly provides functions to determine a particular
date falls in the permitted range or not.

Call 'perldoc lib/DateTime/Subspan/Weekly.pm' for more documentation.
